#Notes for the Robot Test:

Ensure that you utilise TDD; there must be decent test coverage
Object orientation must be implemented. For instance, if you decide to create position and state machine objects, which is desirable, the robot class should be a robot as well as an input file parser and a robot controller.
Your position and state machine objects should follow desirable patterns in software development (eg, immutable patterns)
Ensure there are no bugs; ie, the test doesn’t fail!
Please ensure the code works as specified
Ensure that the tests are not very complex or hard to read
Ensure you attempt to model the domain
Avoid having multiple assertions per test
Make sure the solution appears to be test driven
Avoid code duplications
Don’t over complicate the production code – it’s a simple problem.


Comment: Nice to see coders TDD will make all testers obsolete.
